# Vision Model Testing: TikZ Diagram Reconstruction

## Objective
Find SOTA 2026 vision model that can accurately describe mathematical diagrams for precise TikZ reconstruction.

## Test Methodology
1. Generate reference TikZ diagram (mathematical)
2. Render to PNG/SVG
3. Send to vision models with prompt: "Describe this mathematical diagram in precise detail, including all labels, arrows, positions, and mathematical notation. The description should be detailed enough to reconstruct this diagram in TikZ."
4. Attempt to reconstruct from description
5. Compare reconstruction quality

## Summary of Findings

### Current Best: Microsoft Phi-4-Multimodal (FREE via NVIDIA NIM)
- **~80% reconstruction accuracy** - BEST FREE MODEL FOUND
- ✅ 5 nodes, some shapes, some colors identified
- ❌ Missed arrows φ and ψ
- ❌ Missed shaded region
- ❌ Wrong styles (said D has "dashed outline")
- ❌ Label error (C called "T")
- ❌ Model currently DEGRADED (unavailable for re-testing)

### Second Best: NVIDIA Nemotron 30B (FREE via OpenRouter)
- Gets 60-70% reconstruction accuracy
- Handles basic structure, shapes, colors, arrows well
- Misses complex decorations (double arrows, snake patterns, shaded regions)
- **More reliable** (Phi-4 currently unavailable)

### KEY FINDING: Larger ≠ Better for Vision
- **Llama 90B: Catastrophic hallucination** (invented 13 nodes vs 5 actual)
- **Llama 11B: Poor performance** (vague, wrong labels)
- **Nemotron 30B: Best free option** despite smaller size
- Suggests specialized vision training > raw parameter count

### Remaining Tests Needed
- [x] NVIDIA NIM API - tested, worse than OpenRouter free models

## Notes
- Avoid usage-based APIs: Codex, Claude direct, Opencode, Gemini direct
- Focus on SOTA 2026 models
- Test via curl for direct API access
- Model outputs saved in: output_nemotron30b.txt, etc.
