# Handoff: flowmark + pandoc formatting pipeline

## Goal

`zmdfmt`: a source-preserving Markdown formatter for Pandoc/Obsidian-flavored markdown.
Prose formatting via flowmark; structural normalization via pandoc Lua filters + minimal sed.

## Completed

### Flowmark fork (`semantic-without-width`)

- Repo: `dzackgarza/flowmark`, branch `semantic-without-width`
- Installed globally as editable: `~/gitclones/flowmark`
- `--semantic` now does pure sentence-boundary splitting with NO column-width wrapping.
  `--semantic --width N` still applies both.
  Previously these were inseparable.
- Custom block elements added to the marko parser so flowmark natively handles Pandoc/Obsidian extended syntax without corrupting it:
  - `CustomDisplayMath` — `\[...\]` and `$$...$$` preserved as block-level constructs
  - `CustomFencedDiv` — `::: {.attrs} ... :::` preserved verbatim
  - `CustomLatexEnvironment` — `\begin{env}...\end{env}` preserved verbatim
- 335 tests pass (all original tests; no new tests written yet).
- Five commits pushed (decoupling + 3 block elements + checkpoint).

### Pandoc filters (`filters/`)

**`normalize_displaymath.lua`** (81 lines)
- Matches `Math(DisplayMath)` and `RawInline(Format "tex", ...)` containing `\begin{env}...\end{env}`.
- Standalone case: emits delimiters on own lines.
- Inline/mixed case: splits the parent `Para`, separates the block from surrounding text.
- Inline math `$...$` untouched.
  All other content pass-through no-op.

**`normalize_fenced_divs.lua`** (28 lines)
- Matches `Div` AST nodes.
- Renders opening fence with attributes on own line, body content, closing fence on own line.
- Uses `pandoc.write` internally with `+wikilinks_title_after_pipe` and `wrap_text = "preserve"` to avoid re-introducing width wrapping.

### Pipeline script (`bin/fmt-pipeline`)

```text
flowmark --semantic INPUT
  -> sed: split fenced-div opening fence from content
  -> sed: strip flowmark line-continuation backslash from \[
  -> pandoc + normalize_displaymath.lua + normalize_fenced_divs.lua
```

### Test fixtures (`tests/fixtures/fmt-pipeline/`)

| Fixture | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `001_noop_algebraic_spaces` | `%20` only (URL encoding); `\[\` fixed |
| `002_displaymath_inline` | Clean (inline `\[...\]` — pandoc filter still handles this edge case) |
| `003_begin_end` | Clean (now preserved natively by flowmark) |
| `004_prose_semantic` | Prose joined to one line (pandoc SoftBreak issue — not a flowmark problem) |

## Flowmark issues (now resolved in fork)

The original pipeline had `sed` steps and pandoc Lua filters solely because flowmark corrupted structural markup.
All four defects have been eliminated by adding custom block elements to flowmark's marko parser (`semantic-without-width` branch):

| Issue | Root cause | Fix applied |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Fenced-div fence joined to content | marko didn't know `:::` syntax | `CustomFencedDiv` block element |
| 2. Line-continuation backslash on `\[` | Hard-break normalization on display math opener | `CustomDisplayMath` block element |
| 3. Display math layout mangled | `\[...\]`, `$$...$$` treated as paragraph text | `CustomDisplayMath` block element |
| 4. LaTeX env layout mangled | `\begin{env}...\end{env}` treated as paragraph text | `CustomLatexEnvironment` block element |

The two `sed` steps in `bin/fmt-pipeline` are now dead code for flowmark output (they repaired corruptions that flowmark no longer produces).
The pandoc Lua filters remain useful for edge cases (e.g. inline `\[...\]` inside a paragraph without blank lines) but are no longer required to recover from flowmark-originated damage.

## Open issues (Pandoc-specific)

### 1. Pandoc percent-encodes link targets with spaces

`[étale sheaves](étale sheaves)` becomes `[étale sheaves](étale%20sheaves)`.

Pandoc's markdown writer always percent-encodes spaces in link URLs.
No writer flag or extension disables this.
Requires a Lua filter to rewrite `Link` targets, or the links must bypass Pandoc's writer.

### 2. Prose semantic line breaks destroyed by Pandoc

Flowmark's `--semantic` splits sentences to separate lines.
When prose passes through Pandoc, line breaks within a `Para` are `SoftBreak` nodes, which the markdown writer normalizes to spaces.
`--wrap=none` only disables width-based wrapping, not SoftBreak → Space normalization.

Consequence: any prose that goes through Pandoc loses flowmark's semantic line breaks.

### 3. Architecture: prose and structure are conflated

The current pipeline sends everything through both flowmark and pandoc.
Flowmark destroys Pandoc structure (`:::`, `\[`, `\begin`), requiring sed and filters to recover it.
Pandoc destroys flowmark's prose formatting (SoftBreak → Space, percent-encoding).

The two tools operate on overlapping text and damage each other's output.

## Architectural fork

**Option A: Teach flowmark to handle math/latex blocks natively.**

Flowmark already parses CommonMark via Marko.
It could use Pandoc (as a library/dependency) to identify math and latex block boundaries, then protect those regions during its own formatting pass.
No post-processing pipeline needed.
The entire prose path stays in flowmark; Pandoc is only a parsing dependency, not a writer.

This avoids the two-tool damage loop entirely.
The sed steps and pandoc filters become unnecessary because flowmark never corrupts structure in the first place.

**Option B: Protect/restore architecture (spec V2 approach).**

Before flowmark: identify and protect structural regions (fenced divs, display math, latex envs).
Run flowmark on prose only.
Restore protected regions byte-for-byte.
Then run pandoc filters for canonical layout normalization.

This preserves the two-tool pipeline but adds a protect/restore layer.
The existing filters remain useful for layout normalization.

## Resolution needed

Decision on Option A vs B. Option A eliminates the percent-encoding and SoftBreak issues by never passing prose through Pandoc.
Option B is a working pipeline with two additional components needed (link filter, prose protect/restore).
